# Zynthian — Claude Context

## Read First

**On every session start, read all four files in this order before doing anything else:**

1. This file (`CLAUDE.md`) — project layout, hardware, file locations
2. `MD/inwork.md` — active tutorials and future candidates
3. `MD/todo.md` — active tasks and tutorial completion work
4. `MD/agent-behavior.md` — all session rules, workflow, and writing rules (read in full)

`MD/agent-behavior.md` governs all agent behavior. Do not proceed until all four are read.

## RESUME HERE — SP2 is VERIFIED ON HARDWARE and shipped (2026-08-12)

**SP1, SP5 and SP2 are all deployed, tested at the panel and pushed.**
Nothing is waiting on the owner.

**Next action: SP3 — the drum filter.** Its gate passed 2026-08-11 (MDA
RezFilter); it needs a spec, then a plan, then a build. SP4 comes after, and its
ownership rules are now defined by SP2's `owner` flag.

### SP2, in one screen

Pads are the instrument in every mode but STEP; STEP stays the step editor.
**REC held overdubs** into the same pattern the generator writes, and the note's
length is **how long the pad was held**, clamped to the pattern remainder by
SP5's existing clamp. Strikes quantise to the **nearest step**, wrapping — which
is not a delay, because the loop wraps within one step.

**Ownership is the real subject.** A captured note sets a durable
`owner[channel]`, saved in the snapshot under its own **`owners`** key —
*not* inside `voices`, which holds only the three voices, and a drum channel can
be player-owned too. **It is not `writer_token`**: that token is the
inter-thread mutex and clears itself after every write, so it cannot carry an
ownership that survives a snapshot. `_write_voice_pattern` returns early when
the owner is the player.

**Two routes hand the pattern back**, both destructive: ERASE + Group, and
turning any knob that rewrites the pattern. **The handback set is per kind** —
drum: HITS, ROTATE, DIV (LENGTH is excluded, `_set_length` preserves the steps
that fit); voice: LENGTH, DIV, RANDOM (a voice's LENGTH is the shift register,
not the bar count). RANDOM hands back only when it moves **off** LOCK, or a
recording would undo itself.

**Played-in steps light amber.** This deliberately overrides `_toggle_step`'s
old "no third LED colour to explain" comment, which predates per-step override
state that now survives a snapshot.

**Hard-won in SP2 — do not relearn:**

- **Never test note-off on a drum channel.** A LinuxSampler one-shot plays its
  sample to the end whether or not the note-off arrives, so the test cannot
  distinguish a released note from a stuck one. Use a **voice**: a held note
  stands indefinitely, and on release it decays. That difference is the proof.
- **Amber cannot survive a reload on a drum channel.** A played drum note has
  the same pitch as the generated one, so `_rebuild_notes` cannot separate them.
  The notes survive — only the provenance is lost. Unlike CHANCE/SWING,
  provenance has **no truth in zynseq to read back**, so persisting the
  played-step indices *and validating them against the pattern* would not repeat
  the 2026-08-11 mistake. Open decision, due before SP4.
- **A handback must run only after a real encoder delta is known.** The first
  cut ran it on any CC arrival, so brushing HITS without moving it one unit
  would have destroyed a take with no value changing anywhere.
- **Recording adds, it does not overwrite.** The generated line freezes and the
  played note goes on top; the recorded step holds two notes. The pads prove it:
  a step is "occupied" by its *generated* note, so an **amber** pad means the
  generated note is still there. Dark-but-sounding would be the defect.
- **CC 3 (REC) used to fall through unhandled** and something in Zynthian
  answered it with a full encoder re-centre. Binding it fixed that; re-measured
  and gone.

| State | Detail |
|---|---|
| Tests | **248 passing**, `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -q` in `zyngine/ctrldev/` |
| Code | `zynthian-ui` vangelis, `MaschineMK2_linux` main, `zynth-docs` master — **all pushed** |
| On the Pi | Driver and daemon deployed and verified. Snapshot `016` repaired. Pre-SP2 backups at `/root/maschine_mk2.pre-sp2.bak` and `/root/techno_lib.pre-sp2.bak` |
| Hardware test | SP2: **8 checks passed, zero defects** — `docs/superpowers/techno-machine/2026-08-12-sp2-test-findings.md`. SP1+SP5: **23 checks** — `…/2026-08-11-sp1-sp5-test-findings.md` |
| SP2 gate G5 | `…/2026-08-12-sp2-g5-results.md`. **REC is CC 3** (free — `GROUP_CC_FIRST` is 80) · pad note-off arrives on release · `getNoteDuration` and `getNoteStart` both exist in the installed `.so` · pad velocity is `pressure^0.4 * 127`, so the usable range is ~**66-127**, not 1-127 |
| Jam | **PASSED, 19 min** — zero xruns, zero tracebacks, zero segfaults, zero driver reloads, watchdog one per ~30 s against an ~8 s healthy baseline. **No DSP load figure was sampled** — deferred |

**Shipped and verified by hand:** five latched modes · DL/DR page rings with
per-(mode,kind) memory · mixer and filter spread pages · voice CHANCE ·
generated pages from plugin ports · peak meters · sound stepping on ML/MR ·
voice DENSITY · the `1/4` division (four-bar patterns) · notes up to eight
steps · SHIFT/SWING/VOLUME emitted by the daemon.

**SOLO is closed** — specified by observation at last: hold + Fn is momentary
and additive, tap latches the F row into solos, tap again exits.

**Five defects were found by testing and four were fixed the same session**
(`212d886b` and follow-up). The one worth carrying forward as a lesson:
**CHANCE and SWING are per-pattern zynseq properties saved inside the
snapshot's own riff.** The driver kept only its own copy and defaulted it to
100 on load, so a channel saved at chance 0 came back silent while the surface
read 100 and the tab drew SOLID — the one mechanism this instrument has for
explaining silence was reporting the channel healthy. `_derive_params` now
reads both back. **Any per-pattern zynseq property the driver mirrors must be
read back on load, never assumed.**

Also fixed: a voice's DIVIDE had never survived a snapshot load (`set_state`
stamped the in-memory division over the restored one, then read its own stamp
back); generated pages showed host ports (`lv2_freewheel`, `latency`,
`enabled`); and a small-range port could not be moved at all.

**Discreteness is integer-ness, not range width.** The first cut at that last
fix classified ports by span and broke Obxd's 0.0-1.0 float volume within
minutes. `_set_value()` truncates only INTEGER controls, so a port needs whole
-unit stepping when it is integer **and** one percent of its range is under one
unit.

**Two recorded, not fixed, by the owner's ruling:** long notes with repeated
pitches cut each other off (swing exposes it, and the swing behaviour at `1/4`
is wanted as-is); and GATE at its floor is inaudible on slow-attack patches.

**SP3's gate ran 2026-08-11 and it is no longer blocked** —
`docs/superpowers/techno-machine/2026-08-11-sp3-filter-gate-results.md`.
**MDA RezFilter** is the drum filter: `freq` and `res` are already **0-100**,
the driver's own surface units, and it is stereo. Measured a clean lowpass
sweep with genuine resonance (2-8 kHz band 16.13 → 54.27 at res 80). Five jalv
hosts cost **4.60% of a core idle, zero xruns**, exactly as G1 predicted.
**The trap: below `freq` 35 it emits exact digital silence**, so SP3 must map
the encoder onto 35-100 or the bottom of the knob mutes the channel with
nothing saying why. SP3 still needs its own spec and build.

**G4 step 4 caught a silent failure — the recurring Pi-is-older trap, again.**
The Pi's mixer speaks a **different DPM API** than this checkout, and Task 8's
`hasattr` guard would have quietly degraded the mixer meter to fader position on
the only machine that runs it, with no error anywhere:

| | WSL checkout | The Pi |
|---|---|---|
| Module | `zynlibs/zynmixer/zynmixer.py` | `zyngine/zynthian_engine_audio_mixer.py` |
| Read | `update_dpm_states()` fills `mixer.dpm` — `(a, b, a_hold, b_hold, mono)` | `get_dpm_states(start, end)` → `[[a, b, hold_a, hold_b, mono], …]` |
| Enable | `enable_dpm(enable)` | `enable_dpm(start, end, enable)` |

`updateDpmStates` does not exist on the Pi at all. Fixed in `f1c98493` — try the
new API, fall back to the old one, then give up. Both report dBFS.

**Also settled by step 4: RATCHET is unblocked.** `setStutterCount`,
`setStutterDur` and `changeStutterCountAll` are all in the installed
`libzynseq.so`, along with `setPlayChance`, `setNotePlayChance`,
`setSwingAmount` and `setSwingDiv`. `addNote` is 5-arg.

**The button CC map is MEASURED now, gate G4, 2026-08-11** — one press per
button with `aseqdump`. Raw log:
`docs/superpowers/techno-machine/2026-08-11-g4-capture.log`.

| Name | Panel | Daemon token | **CC** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DL / DR** | arrows beside the display | `page_left` / `page_right` | **47 / 48** |
| **ML / MR** | master section, beside the big encoder | `nav_left` / `nav_right` | 13 / 14 |
| **TL / TR** | transport ◀STEP / STEP▶ | `step_left` / `step_right` | **5 / 6, fully emitted — free surface** |

**The daemon's token names are attached to the opposite physical buttons from
what they suggest.** Every earlier claim here was read out of those names, and
two were wrong from 2026-08-08 until G4. **Retracted: "the display arrows send
CC 5/6" and "TL/TR is swallowed by the daemon".** Both false. Fixed in the
driver at `eb26b00c`. Never bind a button without a capture.

Everything else measured, and unbound unless noted: GRID 4 · CONTROL 11 · big
encoder **press 12** · big encoder **turn 15** (8 units per detent, wraps
120 → 0) · SCENE 25 · PATTERN 26 · PAD MODE 27 · DUPLICATE 29 · SELECT 30 ·
SOLO 31 · STEP 32 · MUTE 33 · NAVIGATE 34 · AUTO 37 · ALL 38 · SHIFT 49 ·
SWING 50 · VOLUME 51. **There is no VIEW button on the MK2** — the 8-button
block is scene, pattern, pad mode, navigate, duplicate, select, solo, mute.

**Two deploy traps found while deploying the daemon patch:**

- **The Pi's `MaschineMK2_linux` git HEAD is `7038f60`, an old display
  experiment, and the running code exists only as uncommitted working-tree
  changes** — byte-identical to WSL's `b567fb0`, verified file by file. A
  `git reset --hard` or bundle checkout there **destroys the working daemon**.
  Deploy by copying the changed file. Backup: `/root/main.rs.b567fb0.bak`.
- **Restart order is daemon first, UI second.** Restarting `maschine-mk2` alone
  makes a2j re-register the Pads port onto a *new* zmip slot while the ctrldev
  driver stays bound to the dead one — the rig goes silent with no error. It is
  also what leaves a second stale route behind.

**Architecture, so the next session does not re-derive it:** a page descriptor
carries a **shape**, and the shape is the whole trick — `channel` is eight verbs
of the selected channel (the shipped layout), `spread` is one verb across all
eight channels (mixer, filter, swing, chance), `global` is eight globals (ALL).
`techno_lib.PAGE_RINGS` holds them, keyed `(mode, kind)`; `COLUMN_VERBS` is
gone. `_encoder_column` is a three-way dispatch into the unchanged
`_verb(verb, channel, …)`. CONTROL pages 2+ and ALL pages 2-3 are **generated**
from whatever the chain publishes, so no table here needs to know JC303's or
TAP Reverberator's ports.

**Found during the build — do not relearn:**

- **`screen_packets` had a shadowing bug in shipped code.** Its tab loop used a
  local named `label`, which clobbered the new page-label parameter, so both
  screens drew the last tab's text at the indicator row. Renamed `tab_label`.
- **`_verb`'s first line asks the channel for its kind**, so a global page
  cannot pass `channel=None` — it raises before the global branch is reached.
  Globals pass the selected channel, exactly as the shipped ALL page did.
- **`zynmixer.DPM` is `(a, b, a_hold, b_hold, mono)`**, not `peakA`. The meter
  shows the louder of `a`/`b`. Both the meter and `enable_dpm` are guarded —
  the Pi's `libzynmixer` is older and may export neither, in which case the bar
  keeps showing fader position.
- **The screen layout shifted** to make room for the page indicator: rule 13,
  label 15, names 24, values 32, bars unchanged at 52. Not yet seen on glass.
- **CC 5/6 is verified on the wire** as the arrows beside the display — the
  driver's own comment says so. The old constant was misnamed `CC_PAGE_LEFT`.
- **The driver cannot be imported on WSL** (`zynlibs.zynseq` is Pi-only), so
  driver changes verify with `python3 -m py_compile` and nothing more. Push
  logic into `techno_lib.py`, where it is unit tested.

**SP2-SP4 are specced but not built:** SP2 live pad play + REC recording, SP3
the drum filter (blocked on the Pi), SP4 channel type switching on SHIFT+GRID.
Decisions already taken for them are in the spec — do not re-litigate.

## Techno Machine prototype SHIPPED (2026-08-11)

**The techno machine is built, hardware-verified and documented.** Five euclidean
drum channels, three Turing-machine voices, sixteen post-fader inserts, three
latched pages, played entirely from the Maschine MK2. **No daemon work was
needed — no Rust, no `git bundle` dance.**

**Read the manual first if you are playing it, not building it:**
`~/zynth/TECHNO-MACHINE-MANUAL.md` (→ `docs/superpowers/techno-machine/2026-08-10-techno-machine-manual.md`).

**The twenty-minute jam passed, 2026-08-11:** JACK DSP load mean 21.1% / p95 37%,
**zero xruns, zero segfaults, zero tracebacks**, memory flat over twenty minutes,
watchdog reopens one per 22.6 s against a healthy baseline of ~8 s. Three Turing
voices rewriting a pattern every ~0.6 s is exactly the load that killed the UI
with SIGSEGV before the lock existed, so this retires risks R1 and R6.

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Snapshot in use | `016-techno_maschine` (bank 000). `021-maschine-drum-rig-sfz` is kept as the drum-only fallback |
| Driver | `zyngine/ctrldev/zynthian_ctrldev_maschine_mk2.py` + `techno_lib.py`. 118 unit tests as shipped; **164 on the unpushed pass-two work** |
| Manual | `docs/superpowers/techno-machine/2026-08-10-techno-machine-manual.md` |
| Gate results | `docs/superpowers/techno-machine/2026-08-10-gates-g1-g2-g3-results.md` |
| Plan | `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-10-techno-machine-prototype.md` |

**Still open, in priority order:**

1. **The two SOLO gestures** are the only surface behaviour never verified. `zynmixer.toggle_solo` is **additive**, not exclusive, with a special case at `MAX_NUM_CHANNELS - 1` that clears every solo — check that first.
2. **Re-measure on `hw:S2` at 44.1 kHz.** Every number in this project is on `hw:Headphones` at 48 kHz; the owner waived the precondition while the Sound Blaster is disconnected.
3. **The tutorial page** — the oldest debt in this project, now covering both the drum rig and the techno machine.
4. Pass two, in order: Lock snapshots on SCENE · the verb layer (one ~10-line daemon patch emitting SHIFT 49, SWING 50, VOLUME 51) · RATCHET via `setStutterCount` · voice CHANCE back on the surface.

**Hard-won during the build — do not relearn:**

- **Never load a preset or a preset list on the MIDI thread.** `midi_event` holds `self.lock` for the whole event, and an engine load blocks on a socket for seconds. It froze the entire instrument and needed a restart. Defer it to the poll thread, as `_commit_kit` and now `_commit_preset` do.
- **`_kit_list()` retries must be rate-limited.** On a chain with no kits it ran `set_bank_by_name` + `load_preset_list` at render rate, under the lock.
- **Any new module in `zyngine/ctrldev/` needs `dev_ids = []`.** The manager globs every `*.py`, takes `getattr(module, module_name)` as a driver class and reads `.dev_ids` — without it the whole UI crash-loops every 14 seconds.
- **`_verb` must branch on channel kind.** Sending a voice's LENGTH or DIVIDE to the drum handler wrote a euclidean single-note pattern over the melodic line, permanently while the voice was at LOCK.
- **A silent channel must say why.** Play chance 0 on a voice emits nothing and had no surface indication; it read as a hang and cost a jam. The tab row now draws it dashed.
- **JC303 and Obxd are omni.** An earlier claim that they answer only on channel 1 was a measurement artefact — an unconfigured `ZynMidiRouter:devN_in` routes to the **active chain**, not per channel, and the probe was not reset between rounds. No channel translation is needed.
- **MDA Ambience, MDA DubDelay, MDA Delay, CAPS PlateX2, lcrDelay and bolliedelay are all dry/wet crossfades**, measured with an impulse through `lv2apply`. TAP Reverberator and TAP Stereo Echo are true wet levels and are what shipped.
- **Sixteen jalv processes cost 16.5% of a core doing nothing.** Any "N% of a core" budget for plugin instances has to account for the host, not just the DSP.

---

**Older context — the drum rig this extends:**

**Read before doing anything on the techno machine:**

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Prototype spec — the live document | `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-10-techno-machine-prototype-design.md` |
| Design synthesis | `docs/superpowers/techno-machine/2026-08-09-techno-machine-design.md` |
| PO / dev debate positions | `docs/superpowers/techno-machine/po-position.md`, `dev-position.md` |
| Drum rig progress ledger (context, not the active task) | `~/zynth/zynthian-ui/.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-06-maschine-drum-rig/progress.md` |

**All three gates ran and passed, 2026-08-10/11** — results in
`docs/superpowers/techno-machine/2026-08-10-gates-g1-g2-g3-results.md`. Two of
them changed the design: G3 disqualified the spec's own FX choice (MDA Ambience
and MDA DubDelay are dry/wet crossfades), and G1 found the spec's CPU threshold
unreachable by architecture, since sixteen jalv hosts cost 16.5% of a core doing
nothing. Both were re-decided with the owner rather than worked around.

**The jackd/soundcard mismatch is still open, by the owner's ruling.** `jackd`
runs `-d alsa -d hw:Headphones -r 48000`, not the Sound Blaster Play! 2
(`hw:S2`, 44.1 kHz) the hardware notes describe, because the external card is
not connected. Every measurement in this project therefore describes the Pi's
headphone jack. Relative costs — plugin against plugin — are card-independent
and are what the plugin choice rests on; the absolute headroom figures are not.

Deployed HEADs — all pushed 2026-08-11:

| Repo | Branch | HEAD | Pushed? | On the Pi |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MaschineMK2_linux` | main | `39c4503` | yes | **yes** — but the Pi's own HEAD is `7038f60`, an old display experiment, with the live code as *uncommitted working-tree changes*. Deploy by copying files, never with git |
| `zynthian-ui` | vangelis | `eb26b00c` | yes | **yes** — the Pi runs upstream branch `oram-2601.1` and the three Maschine files are *untracked drop-ins*. Deploy by copying files |
| `zynth-docs` | master | `9c24d32` | yes | n/a |

**Per-group SFZ drum kits shipped (2026-08-09).** All eight groups run
LinuxSampler from snapshot `021-maschine-drum-rig-sfz`; each picks its own
drum machine on encoder 7 and its sound within that kit on encoder 6. Kit
notes and names are parsed from the `.sfz` files - Zynthian's `keymaps.json`
resolves on the synth's preset path and cannot match an SFZ kit. **Volume and
pan moved to the MIXER STRIP** because `zynthian_engine_linuxsampler` defines
no controllers at all (`_ctrls = []`), so reading them off the engine dies the
moment a group runs a kit; expression is gone with no equivalent. Measured on
the rig: 6.2% system CPU, 249.5 MB sampler RSS for all eight kits, zero xruns,
kit switching mid-jam with no glitch, and kits survive a restart. `020` is kept
as the FluidSynth fallback. Spec and plan: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-08-09-maschine-sfz-kits*`.

**Encoders are relative (2026-08-09).** The daemon holds each encoder's CC value as device state (`roller_value`) and moves it by the hardware delta; `/maschine/encoder idx value` re-centres it. A knob's *position* cannot serve eight groups - mapping it straight onto a parameter made every group share one value. Measured facts, do not re-derive: real movement is **0-4 units per report**, counter wraps are **-38 to -40**, so the wrap guard is 8; a rejected wrap must still resync `roller_status` or the encoder goes dead; and `zynthian_controller._set_value()` **truncates** integer controls, so chain controls must step in whole controller units with the remainder carried, never in fractions of the range.

**Control layout as shipped** (differs from the plan — see the ledger for why): pads toggle steps · Group A-H select · enc 1 hits, 2 rotation, 3 division, 4 length, 5 pan (**mixer balance**), 6 **sample within the kit**, 7 **kit**, 8 volume (**mixer level**) · F1-F8 mute groups A-H regardless of selection (mixer strip mute) · Play toggles all 8 · Restart to step 0 · Erase clears the selected group · **the arrows beside the display** change sample. Group buttons carry their group's colour with brightness showing its volume.

**Lessons from the 2026-08-08 test round — do not relearn:**

- **The daemon swallows its Page ◀▶ buttons** (CC 48/47) for its own page indicators and never emits them. The arrow buttons beside the display are `step_left`/`step_right`, **CC 5/6**. Dump `a2j:...Pads MIDI` with `jack_midi_dump` before binding any button.
- **LOOP play mode must be re-forced, not set once.** Restoring a snapshot rewrites every sequence's play mode from the `.zss`, and the prepared snapshot carries LOOPALL. A LOOPALL sequence shorter than the bar goes RESTARTING at its own end, which the next non-sync clock turns into STARTING, and STARTING does not clock its tracks — the group falls silent until the next bar sync instead of looping.
- **zynseq cannot persist a mute.** Its track record stores type, chain id, channel, output, map and the pattern list, nothing else. Mute the **mixer strip** instead; that is in the snapshot and shows on the touchscreen mixer.
- **Nothing repaints the LEDs after a snapshot load** unless the driver registers `SS_LOAD_SNAPSHOT`, re-derives its cached params and **clears the LED cache** — otherwise the repaint is suppressed as unchanged.
- **Pattern length is quantised to whole beats and always will be**: `getLength() = beats * PPQN`, and there is no `setSequenceLength` in the installed C API. Reachable step counts are `beats * steps_per_beat`; 1, 5, 7, 11, 13 are unreachable with the current five divisions.
- **Phantom drum sounds on pad taps = a stale JACK route.** `zynautoconnect` only tears down connections it made itself, and jackd outlives a zynthian restart, so a manual `jack_connect` from a debugging session lives forever. Check `jack_lsp -c | grep -A3 "Pads MIDI"` — it must show exactly **one** `devN_in`.
- **In webconf's Snapshots page, the Name field + checkmark RENAMES THE SELECTED BANK.** It does not save a snapshot; it renamed bank `000`. Save from the touchscreen: inside a bank, the first entry is **"Save as new snapshot"**.

**Display geometry is SOLVED and hardware-verified (2026-08-09, `bbf2a62`).** 255x64 per screen, 1bpp row-major, MSB leftmost, 32 bytes per row. One screen = 8 reports, each a full-width band of 8 rows: header `[0xE0|s, 0, 0, chunk*8, 0, 0x20, 0, 0x08, 0]` + 256 payload bytes sliced straight out of the framebuffer. Header bytes 5 and 7 were **swapped** in this driver - byte 5 is bytes-per-row, byte 7 is rows - which is why every screen garbled. Byte 1 is an x offset in **bytes**, which is where the wrong "512 wide" came from. Source of truth: cabl `src/devices/ni/MaschineMK2.cpp`. The layout is wired into the ctrldev driver: group tabs with sample names, dotted rule, encoder columns with double-height values and indicator bars.

Full writeup: `MD/display-investigation.md`, first section — read it before touching the display. The daemon exposes an OSC drawing API (`/maschine/display/fbclear|text|rect|raw`) so the layout lives in the driver, not in Rust. Screen 0 = left `0xE0`, 1 = right `0xE1`; flushed on the 100 ms timer, never from the OSC handler — drawing from the handler puts HID writes on the fd input arrives on and trips the hidraw watchdog. Left = A-D + HITS/ROT/DIV/LEN, right = E-H + PAN/EXPR/VOL. **Do not fill a box and then draw inverted text into it** — the two cancel; draw the text, then invert the whole tab.

**Hard-won facts — do not relearn these:**

- The Pi's installed Zynthian and `libzynseq.so` are **older** than the `~/zynth/zynthian-ui` checkout. Never write a `libseq.*` call from local headers; audit it first with
  `ssh root@192.168.2.123 'nm -D --defined-only /zynthian/zynthian-ui/zynlibs/zynseq/build/libzynseq.so | awk "\$2==\"T\"{print \$3}" | sort'`
  This has already broken three times (call arity, `clearPattern`, `getNoteAtIndex`).
- zynseq addresses sequences as `(bank, sequence, track)` via `self.zynseq.bank`; there is no scene/phrase level. `getSteps()`, `getClocksPerStep()`, `setStepsPerBeat()`, `setBeatsInPattern()` and `clear()` take no pattern argument — `selectPattern()` first. Pattern ids in the prepared snapshot are 10-17, so always resolve via `getPattern(...)`.
- The Pi **cannot fetch from GitHub** (root has no auth). Move commits with `git bundle create` on WSL, then `git fetch /tmp/x.bundle main:refs/remotes/origin/main` on the Pi. A bare `git reset --hard origin/main` there once rewound the tree because the fetch had silently failed — check fetch exit status first.
- `~/zynth-docs/tools/patch-autoconnect-maschine.py` must be **re-run after any Zynthian update**, or Zynthian never gives the daemon's virtual port a zmip slot and the driver is "Found" but never "Loaded" — the rig then does nothing at all, with no error.
- MK2 input dying after seconds was a kernel hidraw fault, fixed by a close-then-reopen watchdog in the daemon (`MaschineMK2_linux` `0b36cd9`). Full diagnosis and everything already ruled out: `htmldoku/project-midi-reference.md`, "Conflict 12". Journal lines `watchdog: input stalled, reopened ...` every ~8s are healthy.
- Step 0 is the **top-left** pad. LED index for a step is `PAD_OFFSETS[step]` with `PAD_OFFSETS = [12,13,14,15,8,9,10,11,4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3]` (its own inverse). The daemon's `set_rgb_light` halves brightness, so the driver passes 2.0 for full.
- **Every zynseq call the driver makes must hold `self.lock`.** `libzynseq` is not thread-safe and the driver reaches it from three threads (MIDI handler, zynsigman queued handler, 30 Hz playhead poll). Without the lock the whole Zynthian UI died with SIGSEGV, exit 139, about 95s into a jam.
- **Never drive anything step-rate-sensitive from `SS_SEQ_PROGRESS`** — it is 5 Hz (`slow_thread_task`, 0.2s sleep) and aliases against the step rate, which skipped playhead pads unpredictably. Poll in your own thread and cache clocks-per-step so the hot path never calls `selectPattern()` (that writes zynseq's single global pattern selection and fights the pattern editor for it).
- **`TOGGLE_PLAY` is not a sequencer transport** — it resolves to `cuia_toggle_audio_play()`, which toggles the audio file player, or just the one pattern if the pattern editor is on screen. Use `setPlayState` on every sequence; it starts JACK transport itself.
- **`"external_pad_leds": true` must stay in the daemon's `maschine.json`** or the daemon repaints pads on press/release in its own global colour and the first touch destroys the per-group picture. It is not in git on the Pi — `git reset --hard` there wipes it, so re-set it after every deploy.
- `chain_manager.get_chain_ids_by_midi_chan()` **does not exist** on the Pi. Use `chain_manager.midi_chan_2_chain_ids[chan]`, as its own pattern editor does.
- **Filter control on FluidSynth drum kits is a dead end** — CC 74/71 are unipolar SoundFont modulators that only *add* to `initialFilterFc`, and `FluidDrums.sf2` ships wide open at 13500 cents. There is no pitch/tune controller either. Real filtering needs an LV2 filter per chain.
- `encoder_step` in the daemon receives the encoder's **absolute counter byte**, not a delta (`mikro.rs:415` passes `byte as i32`); `send_encoder_cc` divides it by 4. Treating it as a delta pins anything driven by it instantly.
- Redrawing the display per input report starves the input reader and trips the hidraw watchdog. Rate-limit to the existing 100ms display timer.
- LED report byte layout is now measured, not guessed — see `MD/display-investigation.md` and the ledger. `/maschine/rawled` and `/maschine/display/test|opts|calib|clear` exist for mapping more of it.
- `ZYNTHIAN_LOG_LEVEL=20` is currently set on the Pi so ctrldev load lines are visible. Clear it with `systemctl unset-environment ZYNTHIAN_LOG_LEVEL` once debugging is done.

**Open items not yet in the plan:** the display's vertical row mapping (above); per-group *kit* switching across the 42 drum-machine SFZ kits in `/zynthian/zynthian-data/soundfonts/sfz/Drum Machines/`, which would beat any CC for character; `light_buf2` bytes 17-31 and several `light_buf3` transport bytes still unverified; and sub-project 2 (two Turing-machine voices on the SMC-PAD) has no spec yet.

**Closed 2026-08-08:** group-button RGB layout is mapped (full RGB triplets, starts 1, 7, 13, 22, 25, 34, 37, 46) and the cold-boot ordering race survived a real power cycle with the alias present and bound. One sample only — if it recurs, the fix is `After=maschine-mk2.service`.

## Working Rules

General engineering behavior. `MD/agent-behavior.md` remains authoritative for tutorial process, tone, and writing rules.

1. Resolve ambiguity from code, docs, and git history first; ask only when the answer changes what you build and you can't derive it. Unattended: pick the most reasonable interpretation, proceed, log the assumption.
2. Match solution weight to problem weight — no abstraction or flexibility for a need that doesn't exist yet (YAGNI). Justify any indirection in one sentence or drop it.
3. Don't touch unrelated code. Surface design smells and out-of-scope bugs separately (note, don't fix inline) so we triage them as their own issue.
4. Flag uncertainty explicitly — confidence without certainty does more damage than admitting a gap. When a question is testable, run a small low-risk experiment and bring hypothesis + result instead of guessing.
5. Propose structurally better paths — especially lasting over tactical — before implementing the obvious patch. Brief: what, why better, the cost.
6. Verify before claiming done. Run it, show the output. Evidence before assertions.

## Hardware Setup

| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Hardware | Raspberry Pi 4, ZynthianOS |
| Kit / encoders | None — no physical hardware kit |
| Touchscreen | Elecrow ESP32 5" 800×480 — HDMI (video) + USB (touch). Working. |
| Access methods | Touchscreen (V5 keypad active) · SSH · webconf (`http://zynthian.local`) · VNC |
| SSH | `ssh root@192.168.2.123` — SSH key configured in WSL (mDNS `.local` does not resolve from WSL2) |
| Audio interface | Creative Sound Blaster Play! 2 — USB, 2-in 2-out, 44.1 kHz, ALSA name `hw:S2`. Temporary replacement for U46DJ (buggy USB hub issues). |
| MIDI keyboard | E-MU Xboard (25/49/61 series) — USB/MIDI keyboard controller, 16 CC knobs, pitch/mod wheels, aftertouch |
| MIDI pad controller | SMC-PAD — 16-pad USB/Bluetooth controller, 8 encoders, DAW transport, note repeat |

Tutorial navigation uses V5 touch keypad (primary), SSH, and webconf. Never assume physical encoders or hardware kit buttons. Touchscreen (V5 keypad at left) is active and working — use it as the primary navigation method. Webconf stays only for: MIDI port enable/disable, audio/JACK settings.

```

Tutorials go in `htmldoku/` under the **Personal Projects** section. The sidebar entries are configured in `generate-html.py`.

**Publishing a tutorial means: edit `htmldoku/*.md`, run `generate-html.py`, commit both, push.**

```bash
cd ~/zynth-docs
python3 htmldoku/generate-html.py
git add htmldoku/mytutorial.md docs/zynthian-Doku/mytutorial.html
git commit -m "docs: add tutorial — <title>"
git push
```
